# Video Game API Frontend
This is a user interface to go with the Spring Boot REST [Video Game API](https://github.com/jamesaiello42/Video-Game-API).

## About Frontend
The AngularJs frontend for the backend currently has users and employees login pages. It also allows for a user to create themselves an account. Users can see the orders that were placed. Bootstrap was used to style the webpages of the frontend.
